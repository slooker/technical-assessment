Position: Platform Engineer / Back-end Developer API

Summary: Create a RESTful API that would allow an application to manage users and articles.

User Model:
_id
name (String)
avatar (Url)

Article Model
_id
userId (User._id)
title (string)
text (string)
tags (array of strings)

Required endpoints:
Create a new user
Create a new article
Edit an article
Delete an article
Return all articles (from all users) that contains the given tag

Authentication
This API will be private, used by a mobile app or server side applications so every call to the API will include an API token (example: 5CD4ED173E1C95FE763B753A297D5) to validate.
Please indicate in the API documentation where in the request we should place that token. Note: for simplicity make the token an environment variable

Technical requirements:
The solution should be clear, concise, efficient and maintainable.
Express.js
MongoDB
Please do not use auto-generated code, start from scratch
Please use a public repository on Github or Bitbucket and treat this assignment as a work project, doing frequent and descriptive commits as this will be evaluated as well.
You are of course free to use whatever resources or references that are available to you but it is expected that the design/solution will be 100% your own.


Please choose your tools wisely, do not try to impress with the latest framework/library version if you donâ€™t know it well, pick something that you can show off how much knowledge you have and that you can work on it quickly.

This is a simple assessment but you should treat it as an application that will have a lot of traffic, that other developers will work on it simultaneously and that will be extended with new features. You should be familiar with concepts like TDD, Modularity, OOP, etc.

As a developer sometimes we try to overthink stuff, focus on the requirements and deliver clean, readable and reusable code.

This is not a time sensitive assessment and we know that you probably have a full-time job while applying, so take your time. If you need to refactor, take one more day and do it. You should send us your best code.

Deliverables: You should send us back a Github/Bitbucket repository link, with clear instructions on how to build and run the application as a well as the API documentation.
